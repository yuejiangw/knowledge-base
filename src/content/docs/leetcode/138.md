[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)


## Problem Description

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

## Example

```text
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

## Solution

**Solution 1. HashMap**

1. Use a hash map to store the corresponding copied node with the original node.
2. Reiterate the original linked list, link the random pointers of the copied nodes.
3. Return the new head.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head: return None
        curr = head
        # k: original node
        # v: copied node
        hash_map = {}
        while curr:
            hash_map[curr] = Node(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next

        curr = head
        while curr:
            hash_map[curr].next = hash_map.get(curr.next)
            hash_map[curr].random = hash_map.get(curr.random)
            curr = curr.next
        
        return hash_map[head]
```

**Solution 2. In-place operation**

1. Copy each node and link the copied node right behind the corresponding original node. For example, 1 → 2 → 3 would become 1 → 1' → 2 → 2' → 3 → 3'.
2. Link the copied node's random pointer.
3. Divide the original nodes and the copied nodes into two linked lists, and the second one is what we want.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)


```python
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head: return None
        # copy 
        node, node_copy = head, None
        while node:
            node_copy = Node(node.val)
            node_copy.next = node.next
            node.next = node_copy
            node = node_copy.next
        # link the copied node's random pointer
        node = head
        while node:
            if node.random:
                node.next.random = node.random.next
            node = node.next.next
        # divide
        new_head = head.next
        node, tmp = head, None
        while node and node.next:
            tmp = node.next
            node.next = tmp.next
            node = tmp

        return new_head
```
