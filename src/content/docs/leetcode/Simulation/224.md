[224. Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)

[227. Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)

[772. Basic Calculator III](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-iii/)


## Problem Description

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

## Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

## Solution

1. Use two stacks, one for storing the operands, and the other for storing the operators.
2. For each operator, use a hash map to mark the priority relations among them. The operator with higher priority will have a larger value, and two operators with the same priority will have the same value.
3. The original expression may have spaces, parenthesis, and negative numbers in it, so to make it a normal format, we would carry the following steps:
   
   * Add a pair of parenthesis at the outermost of the expression.
   * Delete all the spaces in the expression.
   * Replace the string in the format of '(-' into '(0-', so that we won't need to pay attention to the operations among negative numbers.

4. For each character in the expression string, there may be the following possibilities:
   
   * If the character is a digit, then find all the continuous digits, convert them into an integer, and push the integer into the operand stack.
   * If the character is a left parenthesis, then push it into the operator stack.
   * If the character is a right parenthesis, then compute the sub-expression's value based on current state of the two stacks until find the left parenthesis in the operator stack. Then pop the left parenthesis and push the computed value into the operand stack, which means we have finished computing the value of the sub-expression between the pair of parenthesis.
   * If the character is an arithmetic operator, then before pushing it into the operator stack, we should compute the current sub-expression until we meet an operator in the operator stack whose priority is smaller than the current character.

5. After iterating and processing all the characters in the expression string, there should be only one number left in the operand stack, return it.

                    if op_prio[pre_op] < op_prio[c]:
                        break
