## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from nums using the following algorithm:

1. Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in nums.
2. Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
3. Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.

Return the maximum binary tree built from nums.

## Example

```text
Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]
Explanation: The recursive calls are as follow:
- The largest value in [3,2,1,6,0,5] is 6. Left prefix is [3,2,1] and right suffix is [0,5].
    - The largest value in [3,2,1] is 3. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [2,1].
        - Empty array, so no child.
        - The largest value in [2,1] is 2. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [1].
            - Empty array, so no child.
            - Only one element, so child is a node with value 1.
    - The largest value in [0,5] is 5. Left prefix is [0] and right suffix is [].
        - Only one element, so child is a node with value 0.
        - Empty array, so no child.
```

## Solution

We should use preorder traversal to build the tree. As for the recursion function, the parameter should be the `nums` array, and the return type should be `TreeNode`. When there is no element in the `nums` array, the recursion should stop and return `None`. For each round, we should choose the maximum value as the root value, and divide the `nums` array into two parts by the index of the root value, then build the left subtree and right subtree recursively.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def constructMaximumBinaryTree(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        def construct(nums):
            if not nums: return None
            root_val = max(nums)
            root_idx = nums.index(root_val)
            root = TreeNode(root_val)
            root.left = construct(nums[:root_idx])
            root.right = construct(nums[root_idx+1:])
            return root
        return construct(nums)
```
